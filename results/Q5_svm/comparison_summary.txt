Comparison summary (VAL):
Q5 SVM VAL acc = 0.943633
Q3 Gaussian Bayes VAL acc = 0.905010
Q4 Linear SSE VAL acc = 0.866388

Logic check:
- Q4 is linear in full feature space -> cannot model nonlinear boundaries.
- Q5 adds nonlinearity (RBF / poly-2) -> can improve when separation is nonlinear after encoding.
- Q3 is generative on continuous features only -> strong if Gaussian assumption matches the data structure.
